# Revstore
The RevStore is a data engineering project aiming to provide transformed data to the Analytics team to derive valuable insights, so that the stakeholders can make informed decisions.
The project includes processing transaction log data and customer data present in JSON format, making transformations so that the data structure is adhering to the business logic.
Finally, when data is extracted and transformed it will be loaded to tables in the MySQL database.
The project aims to create a robust ETL pipeline which can be used to load similar JSON data into the MySQL database.
